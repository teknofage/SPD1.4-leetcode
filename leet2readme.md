Restate the Problem 
* there is a linked list
* each node has the value of either 1 or 0
* this linked list also represents a binary number
* we need to return the converted decimal number of this binary number

Ask Clarifying Questions 
* data types
* edge cases - could the list be empty? NO Could it be really long? Not longer than 30 nodes

State Assumptions 
* each node has a value of either 1 or 0

Think Out Loud 

Brainstorm Solutions 
* could use int() function to convert a string of binary digits to a decimal number

Explain Rationale 
* this is the best solution I can find

Discuss tradeoffs 
* first solution is simple, but it does not traverse the linked list
* second solution is more complex, but fulfils the requirements

Suggest Improvements - still don't know how to do this
* edge cases 
* other sides of the problem
